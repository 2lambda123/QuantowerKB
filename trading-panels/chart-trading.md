 For example, at the moment you have $82 on your account and 10 leverage is set. It means that you have $820 available balance for trade. This is what you can see in the example.

### How to set up Profit and Stop orders

Then you can set **automatic stop loss and profit** in pips. It's very convenient to set the lot size and protect it. Specify your values in the appropriate fields.

{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/animaciya-3-%20%281%29.gif)

* Use the Qquick Ttrade toolbar 
* Set your values for stop loss or profit. You can also use any one parameter only. 
* Use the button to activate the trade with the mouse to set a limit order

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you execute an order at market, the specified stop parameters will retain their values and will be set immediately.
{% endhint %}

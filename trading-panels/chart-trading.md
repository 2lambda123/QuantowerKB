### Quick change order amount buttons 

The quick change order amount buttons will help you change the specified volume in one click, based on your trading strategy. You can set by default any parameters that you need to quickly change the values. Moreover, the buttons can change not only the specified position volume, but also apply any \(!!!\) formulas to calculate the order volume. To set your personal values for a quick change of the order, you need to go to the settings of the chart in the menu section "Order entry" and find the field "OE buttons"

### Slider to enter the volume of the position in dollars

There are two ways to enter the quantity of a position 

* Entering an order in lots of a traded symbol or coin - this was described above
* Entering the amount of money planned to purchase that asset.

{% hint style="danger" %}
It is important to remember that if you use margin trading, the result is counted taking into account the leverage.
{% endhint %}

 For example, at the moment you have $82 on your account and 10 leverage is set. It means that you have $820 available balance for trade. This is what you can see in the example.

* Use the Qquick Ttrade toolbar 
* Set your values for stop loss or profit. You can also use any one parameter only.

If you execute an order at market, the specified stop parameters will retain their values and will be set immediately.
{% endhint %}

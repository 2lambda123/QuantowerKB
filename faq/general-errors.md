The easiest method is starting troubleshooting with simply **disabling Game Bar**. This could be helpful to remove the key combination and use it for other purposes. Now, you can take these steps:

* Press the **Win + I** combination key to open Windows Settings
* Go to **Gaming &gt; Gaming bar**.
* Switch the toggle of **Xbox Game Bar for things like recording game clips, screenshots, and broadcast using Game bar** to **Off**. Next, press **Win + G** to see if the error is solved.

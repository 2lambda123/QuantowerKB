* If even after a few minutes the platform fails to start, go to the **Task Manager**. Press **Ctrl+Shift+Esc** to open the Task Manager with a keyboard shortcut or right-click the Windows taskbar and select “Task Manager.” Find the process with the name **"Starter"**, select it and click on **End task**.

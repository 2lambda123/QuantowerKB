# First start

The first start of Quantower terminal brings you the testing environment with the key trading features allowed. This state can be called DEMO-mode, but in spite of other platforms, Quantower doesn’t require you to register in order to try. Once the platform was launched, you will get several elements of the platform, automatically created for testing purposes: 

* Workspace
* "Bind" with several most popular trading panels
* An active connection to Emulator
* An opened positions \(can be seen in positions panel\)

From this point, you can start using Quantower. Try to customize the workspace, open new panels or create your first orders.

## Emulator connection

An emulator is a DEMO connection, available in Quantower connections screen. Technically, it is a special module of Quantower’s core, responsible for trading data generation. This means that once you connect to Emulator, it will start to produce the dummy quotes for a limited list of symbols; just for testing purposes.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note! Emulator consumes a certain amount of resources of your PC, so it can influence its performance. We recommend you to disconnect in case you don’t use it.
{% endhint %}

## DEMO-mode possibilities

Due to the special DEMO-mode enabled while your first start, you have a limited functionality in Quantower terminal. The list of features, available in DEMO-mode:

* Workspace modification
* Open Panels
* Create binds, groups of panels
* Open orders for Emulator’s symbols
* Managing positions
* Using the Basic features of each panel
* Global settings modification

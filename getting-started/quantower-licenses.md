# Quantower Licenses

We deliver the most popular trading and analytics functionality for free, but some valuable and market-specific features are available under the paid License.

{% hint style="info" %}
In case of any problems with your Quantower Account or License purchase — please [contact our Support team](https://www.quantower.com/contact-us)
{% endhint %}

To use any paid License, the trader needs to have an active [Quantower Account](quantower-account.md). If you don’t have one, you can create it during your License purchase process.

* Two indicators per chart
* One symbol overlay per chart
* one active connection to any broker, data feed, or exchange

### 7-day Trial period

To access all the features of the All-in-one version of Quantower, you can take advantage of the 7-day trial period. To do this, you must [register for a free Quantower account](quantower-account.md) and log in via the application. Once you confirm your account via email, the trial period will be automatically granted.

### Free version + one pro feature

If you want to purchase specific pro features instead of paying for the entire package, you can download and register for a Quantower account. Afterward, you can select and purchase the desired feature by clicking on the "Buy pro-features apart" link on the pricing page. This way, you can use the free version of Quantower along with the particular pro feature you require.

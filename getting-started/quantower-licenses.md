We deliver the most popular trading and analytics functionality for free, but some valuable and market-specific features are available under the paid License.

To use any paid License, the trader needs to have an active [Quantower Account](quantower-account.md). If you don’t have one, you can create it during your License purchase process.

## License types

We offer a user with a Free license and two paid Licenses — Basic & Premium. 

**Free license** is granted by default once you have created a Quantower Account. Also, it will be available all the time when you don’t have any active paid License. Using Free license, you can freely connect to and trade with any available vendor as well as use the most panels and functions of the platform.

**Basic license** includes some additional functionalities for working with symbol’s history, unlimited chart overlays, and trading simulation.

**Premium license** gives access to the maximum set of Quantower features including professional and niche-specific trading functionality. Third-party plug-ins are charged separately.

## License purchase

If you would like to upgrade your Free license, go to our [Pricing page](https://www.quantower.com/pricing) and click on the **BUY BASIC** or **BUY PREMIUM** button.

The purchase process starts with the authorization in the Quantower service. Use your email and password to Sign in to the account. If you don’t have one yet, follow the instructions on [Quantower Account manual](quantower-account.md). Just after you successfully Log in, you will be redirected to the purchase Cart.

Purchase cart contains the previously selected License type, term of validity and final Price. You can modify the term of validity to any desired option.

The next step is to select a payment provider and press the **Pay** button.

# General settings

## General info

General settings — is a screen, where you can set up the most common behavior of the whole Quantower application. It is logically grouped into several tabs: 

* General
* Control Center
* Sounds
* Confirmations & Warnings
* Time zone settings

{% hint style="info" %}
The most settings are applied automatically, once you change them, but, in some cases, you will be prompted to confirm the changes apply; this action is required for complex settings, where the one change will influence a complex logic.
{% endhint %}

General settings are backed up automatically every 5 minutes by default and you can control this behavior in the General tab.

In case you are trading in various markets that are in different time zones, you will find it useful to switch the time indicator in [**Control center**](control-center.md) to one of your favorite market times.

In Time zone settings group you can select what time zones are your favorite and should be displayed in a pop-up screen when you click the [**Time**](control-center.md#time-and-time-zones) in **Control center**. Once you select several items from this list, you will then be able to switch between them easily.

### How to Reset All Settings to default

Sometimes all platform's settings need to be reset to default. To do this, close the platform, **Right-click** on Quantower icon and select **Open File Location** from the context menu.

{% hint style="success" %}
You can save the current settings if you want to return to them later. Just rename your **Settings** folder to something else, like _**Settings\_My**_ etc.
{% endhint %}

_Rename the **Settings** folder_ \(for example, Settings1 or Settings\_old\). After you rename the folder, run the platform. The new Settings folder will automatically appear with default settings.

### How to share your Templates with other traders

{% hint style="success" %}
You can share your templates with other Quantower traders by sharing template files with them. Template files can be found in the folder **"Quantower -&gt; Settings -&gt; Templates"**

The file to be transferred must be placed in a similar folder on another computer
{% endhint %}

Recall that in the Quantower platform, all created templates are stored in the Control Center sidebar in the **"Templates"** group. Thus, you can launch any template from this location at any time with a single click. You can place your saved templates in the Favorites panel in the Control Center, just like any other default panel.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is done in exactly the same way as described above, except that we transfer a different file **\Quantower\Settings\Workspaces**

The file to be transferred must be placed in a similar folder on another computer
{% endhint %}

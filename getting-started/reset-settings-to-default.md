You can save the current settings if you want to return to them later. Just rename your **Settings** folder to something else, like _**Settings\_My**_ etc.

A folder with the main files of the latest \(installed\) version of the program will open.   
_**Go to the main folder of the platform.**_

_Rename the **Settings** folder_ \(for example, Settings1 or Settings\_old\). After you rename the folder, run the platform. The new Settings folder will automatically appear with default settings.

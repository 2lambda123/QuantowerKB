# Set as Default

Flexible platform settings allow you to customize any panel on your own. Change the font, color, add indicators, determine the displaing of the required columns in the table, etc.

But if you donâ€™t want to configure the newly opened panels every time, we have created the **Set as Default** option that redefines the factory settings.

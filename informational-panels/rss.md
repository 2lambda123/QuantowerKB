### Custom RSS channel

If necessary, you can add any nes source. To do this, specify a link to this source in the connection settings. Here you can see the list of currently available feeds. You can change the name or URL per each feed item. In case you would like to add a new feed, just press the **\[ + \]** button on the right top corner of feeds manager. This will add a blank row to the feeds list, where you can set up the required feed access settings.

When you open RSS panel for the first time, you won’t have any feeds available in settings, so you will see the welcome screen where you can decide: whether you wish to set up your feeds list by yourself \(**\[FEEDS MANAGER\]** button\) or start usage by importing one of the proposed feeds.

If you decide to import the proposed feeds, just check the ones, you would like to import and press the **\[LOAD\]** button. After that, the selected feeds will be imported into your panel’s settings, and you will get to the news view.

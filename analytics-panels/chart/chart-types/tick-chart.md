# Tick chart

Tick ​​Chart draws a new bar after a set number of trades, for example after every 610 trades. Conventional \(i.e. time-based\) charts draw a new bar after a set period of time, for example after every 5 minutes.

For example, each bar of a 610 tick chart represents 610 trades of any size. A tick can be a trade of just one contract/share, or 10,000 shares. This is why it’s crucial to combine the use of tick charts with volume.

# Abnormal Trades

This indicator helps find bars and areas on the chart where a large number of trades occurred over a selected period of time. It can also be added to the watchlist to quickly sort and select instruments with a high volume of trades at any time. The search and selection of instruments is based on the ratio of the number of trades on the current bar to the average number of trades over the specified period.

# Cluster chart

**Cluster chart**, known as Footprint chart in other trading platforms, is an advanced chart type that shows a comprehensive view of the candle chart. It allows to look inside the price and see all market actions. Cluster chart combines several important characteristics like time, OHLC prices, trading volume, number of buy and sell trades.

Using this information, a trader can evaluate:

* trading volume, which passed for each price
* zones of maximum volume accumulation
* zones of high trading interest \(the maximum number of trades\)
* number of buyers and sellers at each price level

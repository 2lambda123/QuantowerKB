# Time statistics

Time Statistics tool \(sometimes called as Bar Statistics\) shows important volumetric values for each bar in a static grid-like fashion. 

Click on the **Time Statistics** button to activate it and to add the necessary data type. Also, via a right click in the side scale section the individual statistic values could be enabled / disabled 'on the fly'.

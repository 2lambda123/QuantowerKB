# Price Statistic

**Price Statistic** is essentially a [**volume profile**](chart/volume-analysis-tools/volume-profiles.md) that is presented in tabular form. The panel aggregates the volume data for each price for a selected period of time. By activating the required columns, you will immediately see Trades, Volume, Delta, Average and Maximum Volumes. Filtering and notification system will show the data significant for the trader.

### Price Statistic & Volume Profile. What's the difference?

As we have already said, the Price Statistic panel contains data in the form of a table that shows the volume profile. Below is an image showing how the panel is linked to the volumetric profile. 

The main difference and advantage of the Price Statistic is that the table presents all available volume data for a particular price, which can be sorted or uploaded to an external csv file for further analysis.

Volume profile and data in the Price Statistic table are built for the current day. If you sort the volume column in descending order, the price in the table \($2,766\) will correspond to the POC line on the volume profile.

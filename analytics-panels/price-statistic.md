# Price Statistic

**Price Statistic** is essentially a [**volume profile**](chart/volume-analysis-tools/volume-profiles.md) that is presented in tabular form. The panel aggregates the volume data for each price for a selected period of time. By activating the required columns, you will immediately see Trades, Volume, Delta, Average and Maximum Volumes. Filtering and notification system will show the data significant for the trader.

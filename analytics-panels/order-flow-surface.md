# Order flow surface

**Order Flow Analysis** is a trading method that allows you to predict the actions of large market participants, as well as their intentions regarding the future price.  
  
Using the **Order Flow Surface** panel, a trader sees all changes of limit orders in the Order Book \(depending on the depth of market data\), which is presented as a Heatmap. The panel shows the placement of limit orders, their changing, canceling or execution by large market participants, as well as the imbalance between buyers and sellers.

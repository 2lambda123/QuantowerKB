# History Exporter

This panel allows traders to download any available history data for any available symbol on their connection and save it in CSV format. You can use it for offline analysis in Excel or similar applications, for comparison or merge with other parts of history.

## How to export historical data

To export historical data to an external CSV file, please open the **History Exporter panel** from the main platform menu.

You can start loading only one selected or all symbols at once. The loading process is displayed on the status bar. If the download process takes a lot of time, you can click the **Pause** button to stop the download process. To remove a symbol from the list of tasks, click on the **Trash** icon.

You can also edit the settings for a loading symbol, like the data type or loading range, by clicking on the **Gear** icon.

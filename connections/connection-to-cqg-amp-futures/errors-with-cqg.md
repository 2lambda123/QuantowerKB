## Error "Index was outside the bounds of the array"

* Make sure that you typed the correct ticker \(symbol\) for CQG connection.
* If the symbol is typed correctly, check in the **connection settings** that the required exchange is activated. If the exchange is disabled, you should activate it and then start searching for the desired symbol again.

* If the correct symbol cannot be found even with an active exchange, it is necessary to re-download the list of symbols from the CQG servers. Open the main platform folder and clear the Temp folder where the CQG symbols are stored. Delete the entire CQG folder and reconnect.

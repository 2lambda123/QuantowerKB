## Possible issues with connection to Topstep account & trading issues

* **Market Data Connection Login Failed. Please contact the FCM/IB who issued your login id for assistance.**

The most common issue encountered while attempting to log in to the platform is an error. This may be caused by several reasons:

1\) Please ensure that you are entering the <mark style="background-color:blue;">**correct password**</mark> to access the platform, as it is not the same as the one used for logging into your personal account.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can find the **correct password on your personal cabinet**, as we have shown previously.
{% endhint %}

2\) Please ensure that you have chosen the correct server for connection, as it is crucial to use Topstep (Tostep trader Chicago Area, Topstep trader Europe, etc.)

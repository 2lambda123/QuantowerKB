### How to add trading symbols from the CQG connection?

By default, we do not provide a predefined list of symbols \(maybe in the next updates we will add default symbols\). To find the desired symbol, go to the [**Tradable Symbols**](https://www.cqg.com/partners/exchanges/tradable-symbols) page on the CQG site where you can find a correct ticker.

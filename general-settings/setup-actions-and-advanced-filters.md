# Setup Actions & Advanced filters

Setup Actions feature allows you to setup certain behavior on some data change in the table. This feature 

Currently, Quantower tables support four types of actions:

* Show message
* Play sound
* Color row
* Color cell

### Advanced table filter

In case you would like to apply some more complex filtering \(multi-filtering\) you can open an advanced filter from panel’s context menu, option “_**Setup Actions**_”. This screen has two tabs on the left side, where the first one is an Advanced filter.

This screen allows you to Enable/disable filtering as well as set up filtering Conditions. These conditions are set up as:

$$
IF (condition1AND condition2 ...) OR (conditionN...) …
$$

You can setup as many conditions as you like. Due to the possible complex logic of filtering, you are required to apply the changes once you finished the filter set up.
